"Help my O2 environment changed!"

  O2 loads in:  '.bash_profile' then '.bashrc' by default unless '.bash_profile' does not exist.  If your O2 environment has changed, it is likely that the installation instructions created '.bash_profile'.  Solution is to replace the installation instructions from ".bash_profile" to ".bashrc"
